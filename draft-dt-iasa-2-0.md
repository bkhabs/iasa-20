Introduction
============

The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF (IASA [](#RFC4071)) were created more than ten years ago, when the IETF initially took charge of its own administration. The arrangements have reasonably served the IETF, but there's been considerable change in the necessary tasks, in the world around us, and our own expectations since the creation of the IASA. What administrative arrangements best support the IETF in the next ten years?

The system has experienced various challenges and frustrations along the way, for instance around meeting arrangements. There are also some bigger questions about how the organisations are structured, for instance about the division of responsibilities between IETF and ISOC.

The IETF community has discussed and continues to discuss these topics, most recently in the “IASA20” mailing list and BOF at IETF98. Alissa Cooper, the Chair of the IETF, asked a small design team to start evaluating potential options going forward. The purpose of the design team is to provide material that informs the community discussion, both in terms of providing a bit more worked through solution ideas, as well as supporting analysis of the implications of those options. This information, along with all other input provided in the discussion, hopefully helps the community and IETF leadership decide what next steps to take. To be clear, the community is in charge of adopting any recommendations or making any decisions. This draft, the output of the design team’s considerations, has no particular official standing.

As a base for this work there is a good articulation of the set of problems we are facing in [] (#draft-hall-iasa20-workshops-report) and [](#draft-daigle-iasa-retrospective). The community discussion seems have indicated also some of the outcome properties that are expected. The scope of the solutions explored included:

- Structural and organizational changes, both externally (with ISOC and contractors) and internally (within the IAOC and subcommittees)
- Changes to personnel resources, both volunteer and paid
- Transparency changes

Changes to the funding model are out of scope to the extent they fall outside the categories above.

The rest of the document is organised as follows. The next two sections describe the background and summarise the challenges noted in the community discussion. The two sections after that explain what categories of changes were considered, and describe the primary options for structural changes. The following section discusses other changes, followed by two sections on analysis of the different options along with a recommendation.

Background
==========

Briefly review current arrangements and point to the relevant RFCs.

Challenges
==========

Briefly cover the main challenges discussed in the WG, and highlight some items from Leslie’s document. Might use material from draft-arkko-ietf-iasa-thoughts.

Approaches to thinking about the changes
========================================

Explaining buckets of changes and the rationale of looking at three outcomes framework for the ISOC relationship part.

Goals
-----

These need to be articulated, and this will also be needed for our analysis later in the document.

Structuring the IETF’s relationship with ISOC
=============================================

From Alissa’s document + more thinking ...
