Abstract

The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF were created more than ten years ago. There's been considerable change in the tasks and our own expectations since then. The IETF community has discussed these changes and the problems they cause. The community has some sense of the properties they expect from future arrangements, including structural and organizational changes, changes to volunteer and staff personnel resources, and transparency changes.

This document is a product of a design team, focused on providing additional information to the community about solution options, as well as supporting analysis of the implications of those options. To be clear, the community is in charge of adopting any recommendations or making any decisions.

Introduction
============

The arrangements relating to administrative support for the IETF (IASA [](#RFC4071)) were created more than ten years ago, when the IETF initially took charge of its own administration. The arrangements have reasonably served the IETF, but there's been considerable change in the necessary tasks, in the world around us, and our own expectations since the creation of the IASA. What administrative arrangements best support the IETF in the next ten years?

The system has experienced various challenges and frustrations along the way, for instance around meeting arrangements. There are also some bigger questions about how the organisations are structured, for instance about the division of responsibilities between IETF and ISOC.

The IETF community has discussed and continues to discuss these topics, most recently in the “IASA20” mailing list and BOF at IETF98. Alissa Cooper, the Chair of the IETF, asked a small design team to start evaluating potential options going forward. The purpose of the design team is to provide material that informs the community discussion, both in terms of providing a bit more worked through solution ideas, as well as supporting analysis of the implications of those options. This information, along with all other input provided in the discussion, hopefully helps the community and IETF leadership decide what next steps to take. To be clear, the community is in charge of adopting any recommendations or making any decisions. This draft, the output of the design team’s considerations, has no particular official standing.

As a base for this work there is a good articulation of the set of problems we are facing in {{I-D.hall-iasa20-workshops-report}} and {{I-D.daigle-iasa-retrospective}}. The community discussion seems have indicated also some of the outcome properties that are expected. The scope of the solutions explored included:

- Structural and organizational changes, both externally (with ISOC and contractors) and internally (within the IAOC and subcommittees)
- Changes to personnel resources, both volunteer and paid
- Transparency changes

Changes to the funding model are out of scope to the extent they fall outside the categories above.

The rest of the document is organised as follows. The next two sections describe the background and summarise the challenges noted in the community discussion. The two sections after that explain what categories of changes were considered, and describe the primary options for structural changes. The following section discusses other changes, followed by two sections on analysis of the different options along with a recommendation.

Background
==========

Briefly review current arrangements and point to the relevant RFCs.

Challenges
==========

Discussion leading to this document has been framed by the issues discussed on IETF mailing lists and documented elsewhere  {{draft-daigle-iasa-retrospective}}, {{draft-hall-iasa20-workshops-report), {{draft-arkko-ietf-iasa-thoughts}}.  The reader is referred to those documents and ongoing discussion on the IASA20@ietf.org mailing list for fuller details on the range of challenges facing the IETF in its handling of administrative matters.

In summary, the key areas of challenge that have shaped this work are:

+ The range of IETF administrative tasks has grown considerably; ensure we have the right structure, community involvement and level of staffing to address them effectively and efficiently.

+ The relationship and division of responsibilities between the IETF and ISOC, as both organizations have grown considerably in the last decade.

+ Alignment of community expectations of transparency of administrative actions and delivery from the administration.

+ Funding and sponsorships. Manage expectations about locations of meetings (broadening of IETF engagement, sponsor preferences), balanced against operational practicalities.  Ensure that we continue to not be influenced by funding entities on the technical work of the IETF.

Of the items above, the first two are largely to be addressed by structural updates, while the last two groups are more about discussing tradeoffs and updating documented expectations.


Considering a Change
====================

Given that a change seems necessary, what might that change include? There seems three broad categories of IETF organisation that are going to be affected:

1. Organisation within IASA itself
2. Relationship with ISOC
3. Interfaces and expectations between IASA and the rest of the IETF

The aspects are of course somewhat interconnected. For instance, how IETF defines its relationship to ISOC will have some implications for the internal organisation within IASA. A more independent, free-standing organisatorial model for IETF would imply new functions at IASA.

There are a number of choices to make within the reorganisation effort. In particular, IETF's relationship to ISOC could be arranged in a fundamentally similar manner than it is today, but improved, e.g., to make clear who is expected to control a particular part of the operation. But the relationship could also be arranged in a different way, for instance, as a subsidiary of ISOC or as a more free-standing, own organisatorial unit.

Goals
-----

The IASA redesign effort needs to address the main challenges listed above. More specifically, a chosen new organisatorial structure needs to do at least the following:

+ Define the roles of the oversight entities and staff/contractors to match the grown size of the tasks. Ensure that we have a structure that can adapt to future growth and other changes.

+ Define the roles of IETF and ISOC in a way that helps the above structure be as clear as possible, in terms of who does what, how are things accounted, and who is in charge of adjustments and control (e.g., staff resources). Propose a starting point for the financial arrangements between IETF and ISOC, either as they are now or changed in some fashion. It shall also be clear to people outside the IETF and ISOC organisation (e.g., sponsors) what the arrangements are and what their contributions affect and do not affect.

+ The new organisation needs to accommodate for strategic, operational, and execution of administrative tasks, and take into account the limited availability of IETF volunteers for performing administrative tasks. The new design needs to ensure that overload in, e.g., operational decisions does not affect the ability to drive strategic changes.

+ Set expectations and limits of those expectations on the different parts of the system. This includes, but is not limited to community expectations of transparency.

+ Ensure that future IASA organizational structure and processes preserves and protects the IETF’s unique culture of individual contribution, clear separation of financial support from technical work, as well as rough consensus and running code.
